                <p>From 4:00AM of when I get up, to 10:00PM of when I sleep, I always start off my day as a race. You never know what kind of race you are going through. It can either be as simple as the 100M Dash or an Iron Man. But throughout the day, I like to get stuff done. In my mind, there is no such thing as something impossible. You can only achieve so much if you put your mind too it. For me, I am optimistic but also an obsessor of getting things done.</p>

                <p>During my time at university, it hit me hard. I can either focus on school and make it a priority, or I can create projects and fulfill my entreprenerual background. I decided that focusing on my career and developing new skills was of bigger importance. With all the projects I have made, I taught myself on how to code. This gave me the opportunity to excel on the future projects I wanted to develop and showcase it to friends, family, and the people of the internet.</p>

            <p><b>The main reason why I built this website was mainly because of the limitations of what coding can do for you.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p><b>During the time of me making this website, I understood the fundamentals of what HTML5, CSS3, BOOTSTRAP4. I personally recommend using your time out of your day and really understand what coding can do for your everyday life.</b></p>

            <p><b>Understanding the format of the coding languages, I will create more websites along the way. In addition, I will create an app before Decembers ends. Stay tuned for more details as the app will be avaliable at the end of the month.</b></p>

                    <p><i>The biggest difference between dropshipping and the standard retail model is that the selling merchant doesn't stock or own inventory. Instead, the merchant purchases inventory as needed from a third party – usually a wholesaler or manufacturer – to fulfill orders.</i></p>

                    <p><i>Yawn Tracker is a web application that allows you to track the amount of yawns you take during the whole day. According to studies, yawning at-least more than 15 times a day is considered a risk due to lack of sleep or a different symptom. Since there are sleep trackers everywhere, I made this application wondering that there are no such things as a yawn tracker.</i></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>This web application gave me inspiration after yawning a bunch of times and wondering how many times I did during a day. After that thought, I wanted to track my yawn ever since and that's why I created it.</i></p>

                    <h5><b><u>How does it work?</u></b></h5>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>The way it works is you go to the web application and track on how many yawns you take upon. The green colour measures on the low measures on yawns you can take but the orange and red colour indicates the high number of yawns you took.</i></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>You can always track the amount of yawns within your friends and family by connecting them throughout the platform. You just send them a freind invite and you will can track your others yawn in addition to starting a competition. The less yawns you take, the winner be announced at the end of each week. You will be able to win yawn achievements.</i></p>

To demonstrate how it works is by putting competition with your friend whenever you meet up with them.

The less time you spend on your phone while being connected with your competition, the more challenges you win. You can also compete in a leaderboard with the surrouding area.</i></p>
